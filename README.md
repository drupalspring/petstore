<li>The use of the EL language in its 2.2 version</li>

<li>A variety of JSF 2 components</li>

<li>Messaging in JSF</li>

</ul>



<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>*The project has been tested on Tomcat 7, even it should be compatible with every Servlet 3.0 container. If using it with an Application Server as GlassFish or JBoss AS, take care to configure the bundled JSF implementations properly because its expected to work with JSF 2.2 implemnetations.*</p>

<p>*Maven is required to package the application. Just use mvn install over it*</p>
